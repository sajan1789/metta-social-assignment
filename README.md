# Country Search App

This is a simple web application built with React that allows users to search for countries by currency. Users can enter a currency code (e.g., USD, EUR) and the application will display the countries associated with that currency, along with some basic information about each country.

## Features

- Search for countries by currency code ()
- Display country information including name, capital,  and region
- Responsive design to support various screen sizes
  
## Debouncing

In this project, debouncing is used to optimize the search functionality and prevent excessive API requests while the user is typing in the search input field. Debouncing is a technique used to delay the execution of a function until a specified amount of time has elapsed since the last time the function was invoked.


### Benefits of Debouncing

Using debouncing helps improve the user experience by reducing the number of unnecessary API requests and preventing performance issues that may occur from frequent updates to the search results while the user is typing.
